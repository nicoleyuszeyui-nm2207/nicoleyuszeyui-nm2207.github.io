      <h2 style="color: crimson">Berlin 1936: The Nazi Olympics</h2>
      <p>
        In 1931, Berlin was voted to host the 1936 Summer Olympics. However, the <i><span style="color: crimson">Nazi Party</span></i> started rising to power in Germany in 1933 when
        <i><span style="color: crimson">Adolf Hitler</span></i> became the sole dictator who controlled the country. Hitler idealized racial purity and racial struggle, thus these ideas
        drove government policies when he became the dictator of Germany. The ideology of <i><span style="color: crimson">anti-semitism</span></i> in which the Jews were pictured as an inferior 
        race, and the concept of the <i><span style="color: crimson">"Aryan"</span></i> race being the most superior and master race, were widespread across the nation. Many Western countries 
        disapproved of the racist ideologies that existed within the Nazis and proposed to boycott the Berlin Olympics in 1936. Despite this, it was 
        surprising that <i><span style="color: crimson">49</span></i> countries participated in the Summer Olympics that year, which was the most number of countries that participated compared 
        to previous years.

        <i><span style="color: crimson">Jesse Owens</span></i> brought home 4 gold medals and <i><span style="color: crimson">Ralph Metcalfe</span></i> secured 1 Gold and 1 Silver medal. Both of them were

      <h2 style="color: crimson">Boycotts??</h2>
      <p> In the years 1956,1964,1976,1980,1984 and 1988, many countries boycotted/ did not attend the Olympic Games. Many boycotts happened due to political reasons.
          In particular, the  <u><i><span style="color: crimson">1976 Montreal Olympic Games</span></i></u> observed <i><span style="color: crimson">34</span></i> countries' non-attendance and the <u><i><span style="color: crimson">1980 Moscow Olympic Games</span></i></u> observed <i><span style="color: crimson">66</span></i> countries' non-attendance. 
      <p> In recent years, fewer boycotts were observed in the Summer Olympics as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) stressed the importance of separating the games and politics.
          It is important to recognise that the purpose of the Olympic Games is to observe sporting excellence and unify athletes regardless of the country they represent. 
          Despite the emphasis the IOC places on this, the  <u><i><span style="color: crimson">2022 Beijing Winter Olympics</span></i></u> was still boycotted by several nations including USA and Canada. The nations did not send
          any minsters and officials to attend the games that year to protest against the Chinese mistreatment of the Uyghur population.

      <h2 style="color: crimson">Something very interesting...</h2>
      <p>Let us take a look at this line graph. It depicts the <i><span style="color: crimson">percentage of medals won by each host country from 1992-2016.</span></i>
        To give an example, the orange line shows the percentage of medals won by <span style="color: crimson">Australia</span> in every Olympic game from 1992-2016.
        The big red point on this line indicates that Australia hosted the Olympics in the year 2000. If we look at it closely, 
        Australia managed to secure a greater percentage of medals in the year 2000 compared to other years. 
        The same goes for <span style="color: crimson">Greece</span> in the year 2004 and <span style="color: crimson">China</span> in the year 2008 when they hosted the Olympics. 
        For the other host countries, they managed to secure a relatively higher percentage of medals in the year that they 
        hosted the games compared to other years.</p>
        <p>A specific term for this trend is called the <span style="color: crimson">Home field advanage</span>, where Olympic athletes from the host country bags
           more medals than when they compete away from home. Some reasons for this trend are:
        </p>
        <p>1) Competing at home means a <u>larger and more supportive crowd</u>, thus relaying positive energies to home team athletes. </p>
        <p>2) Not needing to travel on long flights to other countries to compete help home team athletes feel <u>more accustomed and 
            comfortable</u> to competition facilities and practices. 
        </p>
        <p>3) Host countries may send <u>bigger groups of athletes</u> to compete as home team athletes only 
            need to meet lower qualification standards, thus increasing their possibilities of winning medals.

               went on an All Blacks' decision to tour South Africa despite the United Nation's call to halt all sporting competition until racial equality was reached.
