      <p>
        In 1931, Berlin was voted to host the 1936 Summer Olympics. However, the <i><span style="color: crimson">Nazi Party</span></i> started rising to power in Germany in 1933 when
        <i><span style="color: crimson">Adolf Hitler</span></i> became the sole dictator who controlled the country. Hitler idealized racial purity and racial struggle, thus these ideas
        drove government policies when he became the dictator of Germany. The ideology of <i><span style="color: crimson">anti-semitism</span></i> in which the Jews were pictured as an inferior 
        race, and the concept of the <i><span style="color: crimson">"Aryan"</span></i> race being the most superior and master race, were widespread across the nation. Many Western countries 
        disapproved of the racist ideologies that existed within the Nazis and proposed to boycott the Berlin Olympics in 1936. Despite this, it was 
        surprising that <i><span style="color: crimson">49</span></i> countries participated in the Summer Olympics that year, which was the most number of countries that participated compared 
        to previous years.

      <h3>Data 3</h3>
      <p>In the Nazi Olympics, Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe were the two most decorated athletes in the Athletics sport. 
        Jesse Owens brought home 4 gold medals and Ralph Metcalfe secured 1 Gold and 1 Silver medal. Both of them were 
        African-Americans and Jesse Owens in particular, was known to be the star of the games who destroyed Germanyâ€™s 
        attempt at proving Aryan superiority.
